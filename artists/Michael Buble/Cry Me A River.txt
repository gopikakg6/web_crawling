Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river,
I cried a river over you.

Now you say you're sorry,
For being so untrue

Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river,
I cried a river over you.

You drove me nearly out of my head
While you never shed a tear, babe
Remember, I remember all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love
Well just to prove that you do
Why don't you cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you, over you

You say you love me but you lied

Now, you say you love me
Well just to prove that you
Come on and cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

I cried a river,
Over you

I cried a river
Now you can too
cry me a river
Cry me... a river
