I can hear her heartbeat for a thousand miles 
And the heavens open up every time she smiles 
And when I come to her that is where I belong 
Yep I'm running through, like a rivers song 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down 
And when I come to her when the sun goes down 
Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief 
Mmm, takes away all of my heartache in the night like a thief 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
Mmm, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love (interlude)
Mmmmmmm

Yes I need her in the daytime
Oh, but I need her in the night 
Yes I want to throw my arms around her 
Kiss and hug, kiss and hug her tight 

And when I'm returning from so far away 
She give me some sweet loving, brighten up my day 
Yes it makes me righteous, it makes me feel whole 
And it makes me mellow down to my soul 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love
I need her love, love, love, love, crazy love 
Crazy love, crazy love, crazy love.
